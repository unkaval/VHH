# VHH

Bifrost stuff!  I'm cleaning and uploading the compounds one by one, so stick around maybe?  

***ValHallen's (little) Helpers.  AKA "VHH":***  my Bifrost "pack" - continually (if slowly) added to, changed, fixed, deleted, rebuilt and ultimately used.

**NOTE:** I use my own compounds in my compounds, so you kinda need to grab all of them for some of them to work!!
