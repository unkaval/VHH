Bifrost stuff!  I'm cleaning and uploading the compounds one by one, so stick around maybe?  

ValHallen's (little) Helpers:  my Maya Bifrost compounds and some graphs

As I am using this as Git learning and practise, there will be some (lots of) weirdness I reckon.

Addendum, yes, I'm building a pack, very very slooooowly.  But I am trying to get stuff done most nights, so maybe check back often?
